## About some app bundles in data ##

This is completely irrelevant to the lab assignment, but in case you are wondering what the bundles really mean:
 - [`app.짜장면`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jajangmyeon)
 - [`app.냉면`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naengmyeon)
 - [`app.라면`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_noodle#South_Korea)
 - [`app.비빔면`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paldo_bibim_men)
 - `커피` = coffee
 - `피자` = pizza
 - `치킨` = chicken

In my defense, it was 2 am when I was making up the datasets...
